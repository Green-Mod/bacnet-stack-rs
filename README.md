bacnet-stack-rs
==================================

> This library is a Rust wrapper for the [BACnet Stack](https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack) project built with [`bindgen`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).

The folder `bacnet-sys/bacnet-stack` contains the full source code of the original library.

---

Also this library is somewhat a fork of [bacnet-stack-rs](https://github.com/omnioiot/bacnet-stack-rs) but revamped to use the latest Rust features and to be more idiomatic.
